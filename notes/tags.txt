@Incomplete - something intended and not yet done

@Feature - something considered, but might not be done
	should be followed by a feature identifying tag

@Bug - something wrong with an existing feature
	or makes assumptions that are temporary and won't
	hold up after implementing some @Incomplete

@Cleanup - this works but should probably be made better

@Behavior - is this what we want things to be like?
