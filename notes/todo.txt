# new
features
	implied nodes
	left parameters
	convert between variant subtypes (Location, Value, Target?)
		I assume this means OneOf should be handled as a Value
		Location/Point -> Location/Line on repeat of point...
	disable actor-dependent elements when actors is unset -- might be tricky
	Undo / Back
	reconsider getting actors from parent elements

debugging
	# why isn't GroupSize valid as a first element after SelectorFriendly


# old
command
	parser
		new implied nodes
			unit types (select, build)
			ability types (select, use)
		prioritizing implied?
			so you can say "healing ability" and either mean use or select units with
		implied with left param
		# check type of new node with left_parameter
		# re-add attack left_parameter
		# fill defaults
		context sensitive defaults
		default_value tree or chain
		merge default value for sub items
		skip
		backspace, including removing implied with zero children
		one_of parameters
		allow types to be input that are left_parameters to next types
	element definitions
		are these actually an ast, and the others are a parse tree?
		what does optional without a default value mean?
			for example, Command has an optional action, but that could be a default action of "set current selection"
	interpreter
		execute element definitions
		define elements
	elements
		select units currently taking an action (move, attack, etc)
		sequence of actions
		concurrent actions (with order of priority?)
		conditionals
		stored values with names
		named coroutines
