vertex weights for bones
	by vertex group
	for our purposes we only want weight 0 or 1
	find vertex groups in Object Data Properties, an inverted triangle, with model selected
	in edit mode, assign/remove select/deselect are the tools I use


bone placement
	bones rotate around parent's tail, so keep offset is only rarely what we want
