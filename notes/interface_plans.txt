current command buffer
	element types for parameters should have symbols, not names
		or should everything have a symbol?
	implied
		when an element implies another, should show both on hover of the button?
		
		in the visual tree of the current command, we could have spacing between elements generally, but between an implied parent and child, or implied child and parent, we could have them connected, so they look more like a single block
		different color/shape/outline for implied, default, and explicit

	skips
		should highlight which points are allowed for insertion

	cursor
		command card location should be enough combined with priority allowed arguments to put a cursor at the location where an element on this tab would go


having selector be a left parameter of action had the nice side effect of letting action inputs delineate when to stop selecting. Otherwise selections are pretty intense.
